Every web server has a **time limit** within which the request can be processed. For instance, if **time limit** is set to 30 seconds, each request to X-Cart 5 can last no longer than 30 seconds and it will be terminated after that. It is not a problem for quick requests like opening the product page or logging in, but it may become a problem when you are running a long process like product import or cache rebuilding.

In such cases, X-Cart 5 tries to alter the server's time limit (via **set_time_limit() **function) and allow requests to last forever, but some server configurations do not allow X-Cart 5 to achieve the desired result. This article describes how you can set up your server in order to let long requests go through.

There are several server configurations that do not allow altering **time limit** via **set_time_limit()** function. We will walk through all configurations that may cause problems with timeout and explain how you can set up **time limit** to 300 seconds. You can apply such changes yourself or ask your hosting team to perform the changes.

# Apache + mod_fcgid

Define the following parameters as 300 in your **mod_fcgid** config (usually it is **/etc/httpd/conf.d/fcgid.conf** file) and restart the web server:

*   FcgidBusyTimeout
*   FcgidConnectTimeout
*   FcgidIdleTimeout
*   FcgidIOTimeout
*   FcgidProcessLifeTime

More info about **mod_fcgid** can be found here: [http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html](http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html)

# mod_fastcgi + php-fpm

In this case, set the **request_terminate_timeout **parameter in your **php-fpm.conf** file to 300 and restart the web server.

More info about **php-fpm** can be found here: [http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php](http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php)

# Nginx as Proxy

Try adding the **proxy_read_timeout** option into your virtual host configuration, for example:

proxy_read_timeout 300;

# Nginx as standalone server + php-fpm

Try adding the **fastcgi_read_timeout** option into your **php-fpm** configuration, for example:

fastcgi_read_timeout 300;
