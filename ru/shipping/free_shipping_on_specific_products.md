With the module **Free shipping and Shipping freights** by X-Cart team (available in X-Cart Business, Multivendor, Ultimate editions), it is possible to configure free shipping on specific products. 
    ![xc5_freeshipping_module.png]({{site.baseurl}}/attachments/ref_IU9J0uuT/xc5_freeshipping_module.png)

The module enables you to mark the products that should be shipped for free so that they will be excluded from the calculation of the shipping cost for orders that include these products. The free shipping is unconditional, which means that so far you cannot configure any special offers like "these products, if purchased together, are shipped for free" or "buy 10+ items and get free shipping". If free shipping is enabled for a particular product using this module, this product is always shipped for free.

To provide free shipping on a specific product, use the following method:

   1.  In your store's back end, locate the product for which you want to set free shipping.
   
   2.  Click through to edit the details of this product . On the **Info** tab of the product details, enable the option **Free shipping**.
     (This option is available only for tangible goods; i.e. the property **Requires shipping** / **Shippable** must be set to "Yes" for the setting **Free shipping** to be visible).

   3.  Use the **Update product** button at the bottom of the screen to save the changes. 

Now X-Cart will know that the cost of shipping for this product should be "0" (zero).

You can use this method to enable free shipping on more than one product.

If using real-time shipping rate calculation, any products with the "free shipping" option enabled will be excluded from shipping cost calculation completely.
If using manually defined shipping rates, the products with the "free shipping" option enabled will be taken into account when selecting the shipping methods and rates available for the order (iteration 1), but they will not take part in the calculation of the order shipping cost itself (iteration 2).

The second use case may require some clarification.

## Example 1

You have 2 items:
   * Item One - 0.5 lb, free shipping = yes.
   * Item Two - 0.5 lb, free shipping = no.

You have 2 rates:
   * Rate One: 0-0.99lb, flat rate - $5.00
   * Rate Two: 1-1.99lb, flat rate - $10.00

In this case, depending on the combination of the products in the shopping cart, the shipping rates will be as follows:
Item One only - $0.00 (as the product is to be shipped for free);
Item Two only - $5.00 (Rate One is applied)
Item One and Item Two together - $10.00 (Rate Two is applied: As a result of the 1st iteration, Rate One is excluded, since Product One and Product Two together have a weight equal to 1lb. As a result of the 2nd iteration, the cost of shipping is found to be $10.00 - because the flat rate for Rate Two is $10.00, regardless of the number of items.)

## Example 2

You have 2 items:
   * Item One - 0.5 lb, free shipping = yes, item cost- 100$
   * Item Two - 0.5 lb, free shipping = no, item cost- 50$

You have 2 rates:
   * Rate One: 0-0.99lb, rate - 10% 
   * Rate Two: 1-1.99lb, rate - 15%

In this case, depending on the combination of products in the shopping cart, the shipping rates will be as follows:
Item One only - $0.00 (as the product is to be shipped for free).
Item Two only - $5.00 (Rate One is applied,`50$*10%=$5` )
Item One and Item Two together - $7.50 (Rate Two is applied: As a result of the 1st iteration, Rate One is excluded, since Product One and Product Two together have a weight equal to 1lb. As a result of the 2nd iteration, the cost of shipping is calculated using the percent-based Rate Two, but the rate is applied to Item Two only, `50$*15% -$7.5`)

## "Free shipping" method
For the case when a customer's shopping cart contains only products with free shipping, and, for some reason, the store does not have any other shipping methods that can be used for them, the module provides a method "Free shipping".

If necessary, you can edit the name and description of this method. To do so, click on the method name and adjust the information you require.
