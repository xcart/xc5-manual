When you decide what to charge your customers for shipping, the best approach is to use shipping rates based on what shipping actually costs your business. The most accurate estimation of shipping costs can be provided by using {% link "carrier-calculated shipping rates" ref_ybdiN8r0 %}, or, as an alternative, you may decide you want to configure your own custom rates table. 

In X-Cart, a custom table can be configured to provide rates for:

*   subtotal ranges (The shipping cost will depend on the order subtotal amount);
*   weight ranges (The shipping cost will depend on the weight of items in the order);
*   item ranges (The shipping cost will depend on the number of items in the order);
*   any combination of subtotal, weight and item ranges (The shipping cost will depend on more than one parameter).
